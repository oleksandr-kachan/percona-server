# PS-8882: Crash when performing CREATE TABLE AS SELECT during Alters/Renames

# Create lots of tables in 'db1' and run RENAME TABLES statement
# that atomically moves them to 'db2'. Then number of tables was
# chosen in such way that capacity of Data Dictionary Cache of
# dd::Table objects is exceeded in the process. Pause execution
# of RENAME TABLE at the point where dd::Tables are still pinned
# to cache.
#
# Maximum capacity of data-dictionary cache for dd::Table objects
# is derived from --max_connections value.

# Create tables and construct RENAME TABLES along the way.

# Start RENAME TABLES and pause at the point where DD cache is
# full and dd::Table objects are pinned to the cache.

# Thanks to full DD cache dd::Table objects which are acquired by
# the below statement are immediately destroyed once they are released.
# So premature release of one of dd::Table objects in it caused
# crashes before the fix.
