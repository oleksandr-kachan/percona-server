# Documentation has moved

[Percona/psmysql-docs](https://github.com/percona/psmysql-docs) is the new home of the Percona Server for MySQL documentation. 

We have migrated the documentation and changed to Markdown to make it easier to collaborate.

We encourage contributions to the documentation. The [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/percona/psmysql-docs/blob/8.0/contributing.md) describes several ways to do so, including changing the content.
